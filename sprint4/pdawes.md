## Sprint 4
# What you planned to do
I planned on looking through the code and picking out some bugs we had.

# What you did not do
A lot of us waited to push edits, so I was unsure what was going to be pushed. I found a few niche bugs and fixed them. I wanted to find more. 

# What problems you encountered
Lookingg through the changing landscape of the website, it was difficult finding issues that I was unsure if they were fixed on yet. 

# Issues you worked on
- #77 Sprint 4 Resume Removal Fixes https://github.com/HienVo22/PathFinder/issues/77

# Files you worked on
app/about-us/page.js

# Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I plainly asked ai to extend the dark mode toggle for me.
I looked through the website, I asked ai if it could refresh the profile tab on the dashboard.

# What you accomplished
I extended the dark mode toggle and fixed bugs with resume removal.
