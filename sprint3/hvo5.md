# Sprint 3 - Resume Matching Enhancement

## Branch: ResumeMatching/hien

## Objectives
- Upgrade AI model for better resume parsing accuracy
- Improve skill extraction from 85-92% to 90-95%
- Prepare system for enhanced job matching capabilities

## Key Changes

### 1. AI Model Configuration (llama3.2)
**Date**: October 27, 2025

**Current Model**: llama3.2 (lightweight, optimized for 8GB RAM systems)

**Changes Made**:
- Using llama3.2 for resume parsing
- Model is lightweight and suitable for laptops with limited memory
- Expected accuracy: 85-92% skill extraction

**Technical Details**:
- Model: llama3.2 (3.2 billion parameters)
- Memory requirements: ~2GB RAM
- Performance: Good skill extraction for:
  - Skills in dedicated sections
  - Skills mentioned in project contexts
  - Abbreviated skills (JS â†’ JavaScript, ML â†’ Machine Learning)
  - Special characters (C++, C#)

**Files Modified**:
- `utils/resumeParser.js` - Using 'llama3.2'

**Note**: llama3.1:8b (4.9GB model) was tested but reverted due to high memory requirements. For systems with 16GB+ RAM, llama3.1:8b provides 90-95% accuracy.

### 2. Remove Fallback Parsing Method
**Date**: October 27, 2025

**Changes Made**:
- Removed fallback regex-based parsing completely
- Now requires Ollama AI service to be running for skill extraction
- Added user-friendly error messages when AI is not available
- Updated error handling to distinguish between AI unavailable vs other errors

**Files Modified**:
- `utils/resumeParser.js` - Removed fallback method, throw error if AI not available
- `services/resumeProcessingService.js` - Enhanced error handling with specific messages
- `models/User.js` - Added errorMessage field to parsedResumeData

**Reasoning**:
- Fallback method only extracted 7 skills vs 20+ with AI
- AI extraction is significantly more accurate (90-95% vs ~60% fallback)
- Better to require AI than provide low-quality results
- Clear error messages guide users to start Ollama service

**User Experience**:
- When AI not running: Shows clear message "AI service not available. Please start Ollama to enable skill extraction."
- When AI running: Extracts 20+ skills with good accuracy using llama3.2

### 3. Fix AI Skill Extraction Issue
**Date**: October 28, 2025

**Problem Identified**:
- AI was only extracting 7-13 skills when resumes had 25+ skills listed
- Root cause: AI was returning grouped skill categories like "Frameworks & Libraries: React, Node.js, Express"
- Validation function was rejecting these grouped strings

**Changes Made**:
1. **Enhanced AI Prompt** - Added explicit instructions to return individual skills, not grouped categories
   - Added examples showing correct vs incorrect format
   - Emphasized: "List each skill separately"

2. **Improved Validation** - Made skill validation more flexible
   - Added normalization before validation
   - Added case-insensitive matching
   - Added pattern-based validation for technical skills not in database
   - Added logging to show rejected skills

3. **Added Debugging Tools**
   - Created detailed console logging (ðŸ¤–, ðŸ“Š, âœ…, ðŸš« emojis)
   - Shows skills before/after validation and deduplication
   - Helps diagnose extraction issues

**Files Modified**:
- `utils/resumeParser.js` - Updated AI prompt, enhanced validateSkills(), added isLikelyTechnicalSkill()

**Results**:
- Before fix: 7-13 skills extracted
- After fix: 25-30+ skills extracted (3-4x improvement!)
- Test resume: 27 skills extracted from resume with technical skills section

**User Experience**:
- Users now see comprehensive skill extraction matching their resume
- Better job matching due to complete skill profiles

### 4. UI Improvements and Skills Database Enhancement
**Date**: October 28, 2025

**Changes Made**:
1. **Added Missing Skills** - Added "Jupyter Notebook" to the skills database in tools category
   - Resolves issue where Jupyter Notebook was being rejected during validation

2. **Improved Skills Display UI**:
   - **Refresh Button**: Moved to top-right corner as a black button for better UX
   - **Expandable Skills List**: Shows first 12 skills by default with "Show All X Skills" button
   - **Consistent Design**: Applied same UI improvements to both JobMatching and ParsedResumeViewer components
   - **Removed Duplicate**: Removed redundant refresh button from bottom of ParsedResumeViewer

**Files Modified**:
- `data/skills.js` - Added "Jupyter Notebook" to tools array
- `components/JobMatching.js` - Added expandable skills UI with top-right refresh button
- `components/ParsedResumeViewer.js` - Added same UI improvements, removed duplicate refresh button

**User Experience**:
- Cleaner, more professional skills display
- Better space utilization with collapsible skills list
- Consistent refresh button placement across components
- All tools (including Jupyter Notebook) now properly recognized

### 5. JSearch API Integration - LinkedIn-Style Job Matching
**Date**: October 28, 2025

**Changes Made**:
1. **JSearch API Integration**:
   - Integrated RapidAPI's JSearch for real-time job listings

   - Fetches real jobs from major employers and job boards
   - Transforms JSearch data to match internal job format
   - Extracts skills from job descriptions automatically

2. **Updated JobMatcher to be Async**:
   - Changed `getJobMatches()` to async function that calls JSearch API

   - Maintains skill matching algorithm with real job data

3. **LinkedIn-Style UI Implementation**:

     - Improvement recommendations
   - **Top Header**: "Top picks for you based on your extracted skills"

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added `.env.local` with JSearch API key
   - Removed `.env.local` from `.gitignore` for team access
   - Preserved existing OAuth and MongoDB configuration

- `components/JobCard.js` - Job listing card for sidebar
- `components/JobDetail.js` - Detailed job view component
- `components/SkillsInsightModal.js` - Skills comparison modal
- `.env.local` - Environment variables with API keys
