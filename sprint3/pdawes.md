## Sprint 3
# What you planned to do
So my plan was for making visual changes and adding a dark and light mode for the website.

# What you did not do
I got fairly everything I wanted, but the homepages were not detailed as I would like. I didn't know what to add though

# What problems you encountered
I have problems with the dark mode not having saved per each profiles.
Furthermore, the login screen was also effected by dark mode, which wasn't wanted

# Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I had Ai help me a bunch with getting the dark and light mode starting off. Once I got how to add both, did a lot of that.
Also had AI help generate the background of the homepages.

# What you accomplished
I got dark mode and light mode to work on the profile pages and make the homepages.
