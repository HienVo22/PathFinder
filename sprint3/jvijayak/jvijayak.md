## What I planned to do:
An applied externally page that tracks what jobs a user has applied to and what not. 
It was supposed to mesh with the LinjedIn API but we decided not to go with that so I eneded up getting rid of some code
I had that would have worked with that.

## What I did not do
I think I worked on everything

## Problems I encountered
Just working out how I wanted to make the page and the actual implementation

## Issues I worked on
2Fa
Applied jobs tracker

## What I accomplished
I worked on the applied jobs tracker page component and fixed some issues with two-factor authentication
