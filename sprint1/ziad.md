# Sprint 1  
Ziad Abdelati – ZiadAbdelati – [PathFinder]

## What you planned to do
- Set up project repo structure
- Setup MongoDB integration (#2, #5, #10)
- Setup login as well as Google auth login option (#3, #7, #8, #9 , #11)
- Resume upload (#1)

## What you did not do
- None, everything planned was completed this sprint

## What problems you encountered
- Google auth was tricker to implement than expected
- Resume upload needed to be stored as Base64 in the DB

## Issues you worked on
- [#1 Google Sign up integration](https://github.com/HienVo22/PathFinder/issues/11)  

## Files you worked on
- `/helloplus/zaid/README.md`
- `/helloplus/zaid/app.js`
- `/README.md`
- `.gitignore`

## Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
- Used Github copilot to troubleshoot the google auth integration issues. Was very tricky to get working. No 3rd party code or tools 


## What you accomplished
- Structured group repo and verified it builds cleanly  
- Have base site done, login and google login, resume upload, so much of the basic functionally is done
