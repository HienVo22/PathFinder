##What I planned to do:
Do Google auth, so that a user could login to the website through Google
Two factor authentication

##What I did not do
The Google auth as it was already done and I had not realized it
Two factor authentication is incomplete

##Problems I encountered
Figuring out how exactly one uses an API as I have never done it before
Using MongoDB, javascript, and other frameworks as I had no experience with them

##Issues I worked on
2fa
Oauth

##What I accomplished
I got started on the two factor authentication code, I need to finish it and the buttons and window for it to be usable
