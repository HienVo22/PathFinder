# Assignment 7: Hello World PLus

## Resume Upload - What This Program Does

This is a simple but interactive web application that demonstrates file upload functionality with drag-and-drop support, progress tracking, and simulated AI processing. The program allows users to upload resume files (.pdf, .doc, .docx) through either drag and drop or traditional file selection, then simulates an AI powered analysis that extracts skills and generates job matches.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in an web browser
2. The application will load automatically with no additional setup required
3. Try uploading a resume file by either:
   - Dragging and dropping a file onto the upload area
   - Clicking "Choose File" to browse for files
4. Watch the upload progress and see the results
