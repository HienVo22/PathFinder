# Resume Upload Demo - Pathfinder

## What This Program Does

This is a simple but interactive web application that demonstrates file upload functionality with drag-and-drop support, progress tracking, and simulated AI processing. The program allows users to upload resume files (.pdf, .doc, .docx) through either drag-and-drop or traditional file selection, then simulates an AI-powered analysis that extracts skills and generates job matches.

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser
2. The application will load automatically with no additional setup required
3. Try uploading a resume file by either:
   - Dragging and dropping a file onto the upload area
   - Clicking "Choose File" to browse for files
4. Watch the upload progress and see the simulated AI analysis results

## Technology Relevance to Pathfinder Project

This demo showcases several key technologies and features that will be central to our Pathfinder job application platform:

**JavaScript & DOM Manipulation**: The core programming language we'll use throughout the project, demonstrated here with event handling, dynamic content updates, and interactive user interfaces.

**File Upload Handling**: Essential for allowing users to upload their resumes, which is a core feature of Pathfinder. This demo shows both drag-and-drop and traditional file selection methods.

**Progress Tracking & User Feedback**: Important for providing users with visual feedback during file uploads and processing, improving the overall user experience.

**Simulated AI Integration**: While this demo uses mock data, it demonstrates how we'll integrate machine learning features for resume parsing, skill extraction, and job matching - the core value proposition of Pathfinder.

**Responsive Web Design**: The clean, modern interface design patterns shown here will be expanded upon in our full React-based frontend.

This foundation directly supports our project's goals of creating an intuitive, AI-powered job application platform that makes the job search process faster and more efficient.

## AI Assistant Usage

This program was developed with assistance from GitHub Copilot, which helped with:
- JavaScript class structure and method implementations
- CSS styling and animations
- File validation logic
- Progress bar functionality
- Mock AI processing simulation

The AI assistance significantly accelerated development time and provided best practices for modern web development patterns that we'll apply throughout the Pathfinder project.
