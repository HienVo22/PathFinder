# Assignment 7: Hello World PLus

## Rudimentary Log In Page

## Description:
I made a log in page. This was my first time working with things like Flask, which is why this is so basic. It just is a page that asks for a username and password. If successful, it will say "Login Successful!" Otherwise it will say "Invalid credentials. Try again." Its very basic, so it will only accept "user" for user and "password" for password.

## Usage: 
Download the app.py and the folder called templates and run app.y with python app.py.
This will run a website locally and pasting http://127.0.0.1:5000 into a browser will give the log in page.
